# Prisma Learning Progress

## Introduction

This repository tracks my learning journey with Prisma. Prisma is a next-generation Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database management and interaction. I’ve started with the basics and am currently working with Prisma Client instances.

## Progress

- **Started learning Prisma**: 
- **Completed the following Prisma concepts**:
  - Initial setup and configuration
  - Database schema creation
  - Running migrations
  - Querying with Prisma Client
  - Managing Prisma Client instances

## Current Progress

As of now, I’m learning how to efficiently manage and instantiate Prisma Client instances in a Node.js application. I am understanding how to structure my project to use the Prisma Client with proper instance management for performance and scalability.

## Next Steps

1. Master more advanced querying techniques (e.g., relations, aggregations).
2. Explore Prisma Migrations in-depth.
3. Implement a full-fledged CRUD API using Prisma.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the Prisma schema (e.g., `schema.prisma`):
    ```bash
    npx prisma init
    ```

4. Run migrations:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5. Use Prisma Client in your application!
